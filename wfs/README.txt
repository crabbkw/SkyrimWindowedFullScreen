This is a small utility to remove the window decorations from Skyrim when running in windowed mode.

Skyrim must already be configured to use Windowed Mode.
Change that setting from the Skyrim launcher under "Options" then check the "Windowed Mode" checkbox.

To install it, place wfs.exe in your Skyrim directory next to TESV.exe.

To use it, simply launch wfs.exe.

For convenience this utility will look for either skse_loader.exe or TESV.exe in the current directory and launch Skyrim before altering the window.
